# AccessionTK

Tools to take a table of accession data and associated photos and generate
beautiful HTML summaries.

# QRmagic

Tools to sort images the QR codes they contain (see
<https://qrmagic.kdmurray.id.au/>), and also to print Avery-style sheet labels.

# Site-sheet-maker

A tool that can add a templated QR code to a form as SVG, for when simple
labels aren't enough. We mostly use this for field collection forms, but it's
totally generic.

# Platemate

- Convert between various plate layouts: <https://kdm9.shinyapps.io/platemate/>
